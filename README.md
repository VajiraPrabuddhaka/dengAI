Predicting Disease Spread
## Introduction 
Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne life threatening disease that occurs mostly in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Since the disease is carried by mosquitoes, the transmission dynamics of dengue are related to climate variables such as temperature and precipitation which might help in reproduction of mosquitoes. Although the relation between those are complex and many researchers say that the climate change has a considerable effect on distributional shifts of reported cases. Therefore, if there is a way to estimate the relationship between dengue dynamics and climate changes, the research initiatives and resource allocation to help fight life-threatening pandemics can be improved. The main consideration of this project is to predict the possible number of dengue cases for San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos in Peru using data mining aspects. This task is available as a data science competition in www.drivedata.org website.

## Getting Started..

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

```angular2html
Linux pc with python3 installed 
keras with Tensorflow backend
scikit-learn toolkit for python
Other python libraries like numpy, matplotlib(for visualizations), pandas, skimage etc..
``` 
Please refer to the documentations of above tools and install latest versions that they supported. We recommand to install them in a seperate python virtual environment for convenience.
Please note that If you are willing to run `prophet.py` you should install prophet library as follows.
```angular2html
# bash
$ pip install fbprophet
```
For more details, refer to this: https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/installation.html

### Do simple Inference

#### To run Bayesian Ridge model
```angular2html
python3 final_regr.py
```
If you want to use ipython notebook
```angular2html
final_regr.ipynb
```
#### To run Time Series prediction
```angular2html
python3 prophet.py
```
